# Portfolio Ready Materials

## LinkedIn Version (Short)
Built a **Corporate Blind Search Control Room** that transforms an academic BFS/DFS optimization script into a production-structured web platform. Added modular architecture, API layer, live simulation dashboard, CI, Docker, testing, and interview-ready technical documentation.

## CV Version (Technical)
Modernized a legacy blind-search algorithm project into an enterprise-style optimization platform. Designed layered Python architecture (`core`, `engine`, `api`, `utils`), implemented depth-limited BFS/DFS with trace telemetry, and built a live operational dashboard for strategy playback and KPI comparison. Added reproducible runtime scripts, containerized deployment, CI automation, security baseline, and technical audit documentation.

## 60-Second Pitch
I took a monolithic academic AI search script and rebuilt it as a production-ready corporate platform. The backend exposes a typed API that runs constrained BFS/DFS simulations over budgeted station placements. The frontend visualizes the algorithm live, showing each step, coverage impact, and performance telemetry. I also added tests, CI, Docker deployment, structured logging, and full technical documentation, making the project interview-ready and suitable for real engineering portfolios.

## 5-Minute Technical Pitch
The original repository solved a valid optimization problem but lacked production structure, reproducibility, and operational visibility. I introduced a layered architecture where domain data is separated from search logic and API orchestration.

The core algorithm remains blind search with depth limits, but now it produces deterministic telemetry: generated states, expanded states, coverage progression, target-hit milestones, and run time. This trace is consumed by a web control room that animates search states over a risk grid, so both technical and non-technical stakeholders can see how strategy decisions evolve.

From an engineering standpoint, I added environment-driven config, security hygiene, test coverage, CI gates, and Docker packaging. This turns coursework into a deployable product narrative: “optimize security resource deployment under budget constraints with transparent algorithmic execution.”
